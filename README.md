# Folder-Organizer
 This project consists of a simple folder organizer, where upon running the code, a window will open asking the user to select a folder on their computer. Once selected, the code will organize the files within that folder, moving specific types of files to designated folders. For example, image files with JPG and JPEG extensions will be moved to a folder called "images", MP4 video files will be moved to a "videos" folder, and so on. For files that are not recognized, a folder will be created with the name of the file to keep them separate and organized.  The code was created in Python and is only a first version. I plan to improve it by adding new features in the future, such as a graphical interface and options for the user. These options could allow the user to create specific folders, select which files go to which folders, define folder names, set the number of folders, the number of items in a single folder, and other improvements that I have in mind.
